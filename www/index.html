<h2>DB-UML Database Modeling Tool</h2>

<p>
Welcome to the ArgoUML Database Modeling project.  DB-UML is 
an open source modeling tool for creating, updating and visualizing
relational database schemas.  A UML profile is used to represent
database elements.  Using the tool you can create a new model of database elements,
import relational catalog meta-data into a model and generate SQL create statements
from a model.
</p>
<p>
The tool is designed as an <a href="http://argouml.tigris.org/">ArgoUML</a> module.
DB-UML extends ArgoUML allowing you to create two new kinds of diagrams;
database deployment diagrams and schema diagrams.  
</p>
<p>
Database deployment diagrams show the relationships between physical nodes
and databases.  They can also show the schemas defined in a database.

</p>

<p>
Database schema diagrams are similar to class diagrams.
They show the structure and relationships of schemas, tables,
views and other database entities.

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>
The <a href="documentation/DB_UML_Guide.htm">User Guide</a> has directions
for installing and setting up DB-UML.  You can download the module from this
site to install with ArgoUML.  For a complete package of this module with
ArgoUML, visit the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/dbuml">DB-UML SourceForge site</a>  .

<h3>Objectives and the Road Ahead</h3>

<p>
There are number of objectives for this project:
</p>
<p>
<b>Develop a Useful UML Profile for Database Modeling.</b>  Currently there is no
standard UML profile for database modeling.
An initial profile is proposed in this project in the
 <a href="documentation/UML_Model.htm">DB-UML Profile</a>
Through the collaboration of an open source community this
profile will further evolve into a generally useful profile
for modeling databases.
</p>
<p> 
<b>Support Modeling for Business Intelligence.</b>  DB-UML will evolve
into a more general tool (or set of tools) supporting the data modeling
needs of business intelligence.  Profiles specific to data warehouse schemas
would be useful as well as transformations from operational schemas.
A profile could also be developed for OLAP schemas.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="documentation/DB_UML_roadmap.htm">DB-UML RoadMap</a> details the projects
and enhancements we are currently planning.
